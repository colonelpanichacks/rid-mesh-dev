This script automates flashing WiFi Drone ID firmware to the Colonel Panic Mesh Board. 

## Mesh Detect Firmwares

- [ESP32 OUI Sniffer](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/esp32-oui-sniffer/tree/Xiao-esp32-c3-serial)
Alert when specific OUI(s) is seen by the Bluetooth scanner. Flash via Aurduino IDE. 
  

- [Deepwoods Device Detection](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/deepwoods_device_detection/tree/Xiao-esp-32-c3)
Scan WiFi and BT to form a baseline and alert to new devices. Flash via Aurduino IDE. 

- [WiFi Drone ID Detection FW](https://github.com/lukeswitz/T-Halow/tree/wifi_rid_mesh/firmware/firmware_Xiao_c3_Mesh_RID_Scanner_WiFi)
Sends drone detection messages include ID, RSSI, MAC, Operator ID, Location and more.

## Configure Mesh Nodes

- Official Docs https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/module/serial/

#### Set the pcb mesh device to use serial mode, and configure the pins:

Ensure both the heltec and your receiver node are on the same channel. Set the pcb mesh settings to:
  - Serial mode
  - 115200 baud rate
  - Text message mode
  - Pins defined RX/TX 19/20
